University of Toronto - The Creative Destruction Lab at The Rotman School of Management,"How it Works; ; Milestones are a central feature of Creative Destruction Lab at Rotman. Our observation is that the greatest weakness of smart, passionate, and dedicated (but inexperienced) entrepreneurs concerns the allocation of their scarce resources (time, capital, relationships). We focus the time, attention, and judgment of a number of successful entrepreneurs, the Lab's Group of Seven Fellows (G7), on working with founders to set specific milestones to guide the allocation of their resources. Milestones are of two types: business and technical. The careful selection of milestones is conducted to most efficiently reduce risk associated with the venture and maximize equity value as quickly as possible.; Specifically, every eight weeks (approximately) ventures meet with the G7. At each meeting, the G7 work with founders to set their milestones for the next meeting. A week before each meeting, ventures send the G7 a one-page summary of the milestones set for their venture in the previous meeting, describing their progress on each. During the meeting, the G7 provide founders feedback, introductions to key relationships to advance their venture, and new milestones for the next meeting. At each meeting the G7 identify the lowest performing venture, which is dropped from the program, allowing the Lab to focus additional resources on ventures with the highest chance of success.; The Lab provides workshops that are designed to increase the probability of venture success. Workshops are led by faculty and industry practitioners. Some are required while others are optional.; ; The Lab also gives ventures access to MBA students who are also interested in the start-up space and work with ventures to increase the likelihood of success .; ; The Lab also provides access to a place to work along with professional services (e.g., legal and accounting) at no cost.; ; In addition, the Lab hosts special events designed to provide ventures with access to early-stage investors (angel and venture capital), successful entrepreneurs, as well as potential partners, customers, recruits, and other key players in the technology entrepreneurship ecosystem.",Mixed,Academia,Accelerator,http://www.creativedestructionlab.com,105 St.George Street,,Toronto,Ontario, M5S 3E6,Associate Director ,Tom , Lowden,416 946 8374,Tom@creativedestructionlab.com
